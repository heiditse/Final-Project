 <h5>TESTIOMONIALS</h5>
<p class="resources1">As a part of the New York Times ongoing Current Events Conversation, teenagers were asked how social media make them feel about the way they look. Here are a couple of their responses.</p>

 	<p class="testimonial">Growing up with social media in this day and age is absolutely detrimental to one’s self esteem and view of their own body. There are hundreds of influencers that are praised for having the perfect body when chances are, it’s completely edited. Which gives off the impression that you can’t feel comfortable in your skin without using FaceTune. Beyond that, for those who are blind to the amount of editing being done, are put under the impression that if you aren’t “perfectly” skinny or your stomach isn’t toned and flat then you aren’t beautiful. I have struggled with body confidence and I find myself deleting Instagram whenever it gets too bad because I am subconsciously wishing I looked like the girls on my feed. — Sarah, Wheaton</p>

 	<p class="testimonial">Social media does affect the way I see my body. As someone who struggles with gender dysphoria, it can be difficult to see others online who I think look better than me. For a few years now, I found out that I’m transgender. Unfortunately, until I’m old enough to start my transition, I look very feminine. I want to appear more masculine, but for now there isn’t much I can do. The ability to see so many people online, in this case, other trans people who pass more than I do or seem to have a better transition than me, can be really frustrating …I do still struggle with my dysphoria, and I still sometimes struggle with making comparisons. But social media has also given me a place of comfort, knowing that others struggle and relate like I do and that I’m not alone in this experience.— Ashton, HHHS</p>

	 	<p class="testimonial">I believe that there is a significant gap when talking about female’s body images versus male’s. Not only in social media but also in real world connections, males are taught differently than girls about how to think about their struggles and insecurities. People seem to notice the struggles female’s face when it comes to body image issues, but it is all too common for them to overlook the struggles that males face. Society directly talks about the negative effects of social media on female’s body images, but talks around male’s. They are often discouraged to share their struggles and sometimes even ignored when attempting to share. — Devynne, Comets</p>

	 	<p class="testimonial">I feel that oftentimes men are discouraged from sharing about the struggles or insecurities they may face in relation to their bodies. Unfortunately, I think society has pinned body image issues as more of a “women’s issue,” which is inaccurate. All individuals, regardless of gender, can suffer with body image issues. I think it’s important that there are safe spaces for men to discuss their own personal struggles with body image insecurities. When we help all people, not just those identifying as female, with their body image issues, society as a whole improves as it becomes more accepting of all individuals and their respective struggles.— Sam, Valley Stream North/p>
