<p class="intro1">In 2021, Frances Haugen (former Facebook employee) leaked internal documents from Meta that showed the platform was aware of harmful societal effects, but continued to put profit ahead of resolving these issues. These documents revealed the contribution of Facebook activity to violence in developing countries, the spread of fake news, and promoting eating discorders and self-harm content.</p>

<p class="intro1">This issue was clearly still not adrressed by Meta. Arturo Bejar is an ex-Facebook engineering director and consultant, and the second whistleblower. In 2023, he testified before Senate concerning how meta fosters a culture of “see no evil, hear no evil” that overlooks evidence of harm internally while publicly presenting carefully crafted metrics to downplay the issue. Bejar goes onto to cite his own daughter's experience of receiving unwanted advances and inappropriate messages. Bejar calls for legislation that aim to protect kids on the internet and for the government to check the power of large tech companies.</p>
